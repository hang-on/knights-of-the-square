Knights of the Square
The Mega Cartridge.

Prologue
One day on the SMS-Power forums...

[hang-on] Posted: Fri Jul 11, 2014 11:30 am: "I have uploaded my work in progress game to the homebrew section: http://www.smspower.org/Homebrew/Blockquest-SMS. I have a weakness for Capcom's arcade classic Knights of the Round. Some day in the far future I hope to be able to create a cute/square 8-bit version/transformation for the SMS."
 
[Kagesan] Posted: Sun Jul 13, 2014 4:52 pm: "@hang-on: Great mockup. I really love your style and the boxy little characters. "Knights of the Square" they are."

A couple of years overdue (is this the far future?), it is finally here: Knights of the Square, as foretold by Kagesan. Over the years, it lost some of it's original "blockyness" though. This little demo presents a tentative answer to the question "What if Capcom's classic was a single-plane kung-fu-like game, with cute characters"? Something like Knights of the Round vs. Black Belt. 

Knights of the Square owes everything to the SMS-Power community. From Maxim's tutorials, Bock's and Calindro's Emulators, sverx's psglib to all the resources, friendly advice and encouragement on the forums over the years. Haroldo-OK's framework and tools for Dragonblaster has been a major inspiration for this particular demo.

Story
Enemy forces advance on the Eastern borders. Villages on fire. Mayhem and chaos. You are King Arthur of the Legends. Wielder of the mythical sword Excalibur. Engage the enemy head on as you reclaim the lands!

Controls
D-pad: Move Arthur around.
Button 1: Sword Slash.
Button 2: Jump.
Pause Button: Pause.

Gameplay
Advance through the sidescrolling levels. You will encounter three types of enemies: Soldiers, swordmen and a huge, axe-wielding knight known as Scorn (the boss). The soldier can be taken out with a quick sword slash. The sword man is tricky - look for a way to avoid his sword as he moves around the screen.

Pick up various treasures for bonus points, and food items to replenish your health bar. Remaining time is converted to bonus points when the chapter is completed.

Features
This demo contains the first chapter ("Village on Fire") which ends with a boss fight. I have used surt's excellent art as the base for the background graphics, and added a few tiles of my own.

The following modifiers apply :)
- Cover art included = + 20% awesomeness!
- Source code (ultra fast z80 spaghetti) included = + 256% awesomeness!
