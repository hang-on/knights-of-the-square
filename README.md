knights-of-the-square
=====================

Sega Master System (SMS) Homebrew

A sidescrolling hack-and-slash inspired by Capcom's Knights of the Round. Most sprites are minimalistic 8 x 8 square tiles, 
hence the name of the game.

It is my first attempt at creating an SMS-game. And also my first GitHub experience...
