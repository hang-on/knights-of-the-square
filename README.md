One day on the SMS-Power forums...


[hang-on] BlockQuest - towards Knights of the Round for the SMS. Post Posted: Fri Jul 11, 2014 11:30 am: "I have uploaded my work in progress game to the homebrew section: http://www.smspower.org/Homebrew/Blockquest-SMS. I have a weakness for Capcom's arcade classic Knights of the Round. Some day in the far future I hope to be able to create a cute/square 8-bit version/transformation for the SMS (see attached stuff)."

A couple of years overdue (is this the far future?), it is finally here: Knights of the Square, as foretold by Kagesan. This little demo presents a tentative answer to the question "What if Capcom's classic was a single-plane kung-fu-like game, with cute characters"? Something like Knights of the Round vs. Black Belt.

Knights of the Square owes everything to the SMS-Power community. From Maxim's tutorials, Bock's and Calindro's Emulators, to all the resources, friendly advice and encouragement on the forums over the years. Haroldo-OK's framework and tools for Dragonblaster has been a major inspiration for this particular demo.
